How 

From the first meeting we decided on four clearly defined sections: The Landing Section, The About Section, The Team Section, The Contact Section. We then quickly established that the Landing Section and the Team Section would take the most work so we tackled these sections first. 

The website is built using mainly CSS and HTML. There is a small amount of Javascript used on the website to get the 'sticky header' effect. This is fairly complicated stuff and was based on a video we found online. Each group member has been taken through the scripts.js file.

What 

Code Connect Create - Making the world a better place one line at a time. 

We are a team of developers who work with non-profit organiations. 

Over the past five years we have helped set up coding bootcamps in seven less developed reigions. By the year 2020 we hope to have doubled this figure. In equpping younger people with the means to create cutting edge technology we hope to help them on their jounrney to make the world a better place.

Why

We thought that in making this site it would test us as a group. The Javascript was quite hard and stretched us. We also were quite focused on styling the website.

We hope you enjoy it :)
